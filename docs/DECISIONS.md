## Architecture Decisions

### Component Architecture

**Decision:** Atomic design pattern with clear separation of concerns.

**Structure:**

```
components/
├── board/        # Chess board rendering
├── controls/     # User interface controls
│   ├── atoms/    # Basic building blocks
│   ├── modals/   # Dialog components
│   └── ...
├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
└── layout/       # Page layout components
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear separation makes code easier to find
- Atomic components are highly reusable
- Follows React best practices
- Easy for new contributors to understand

---

### State Management

**Decision:** React Hooks only, no external state management library.

**Rationale:**

- Application state is relatively simple
- Context API sufficient for global state
- useState/useReducer handle local state well
- Avoids Redux/MobX complexity and bundle size

**See:** [STATE_MANAGEMENT.md](STATE_MANAGEMENT.md) for details

---

## Performance Decisions

### Optimization Strategy

**Decision:** Optimize for perceived performance and bundle size.

**Key Techniques:**

1. **React.memo** for expensive components
2. **useMemo/useCallback** for heavy calculations
3. **Lazy loading** for modals and non-critical features
4. **Code splitting** at route level (future)
5. **Image caching** for piece sets

**Target Metrics:**

- First Contentful Paint < 1s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- Bundle size < 500KB gzipped

---

## UX/UI Decisions

### Design Philosophy

**Decision:** Minimalist, functional design prioritizing usability.

**Principles:**

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - UI should be obvious
2. **Consistency** - Similar actions look similar
3. **Feedback** - User always knows what's happening
4. **Forgiveness** - Easy to undo mistakes
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

---

### Color Themes

**Decision:** Provide multiple board themes with user customization.

**Rationale:**

- Different users have different preferences
- Traditional chess colors may have low contrast
- Customization increases user engagement
- Themes are easy to implement and maintain

---

## Security Decisions

### No Backend = Minimal Attack Surface

**Decision:** Client-side only architecture eliminates most security concerns.

**Security Benefits:**

- No SQL injection
- No server-side vulnerabilities
- No authentication attacks
- No data breaches (no data collection)
- No DDoS targets

**Remaining Concerns:**

- XSS (mitigated by React's built-in protections)
- Dependency vulnerabilities (monitored via Dependabot)
- Client-side code tampering (acceptable for this use case)

---

### Dependency Security

**Decision:** Automated monitoring and updates via Dependabot.

**Process:**

1. Dependabot creates PRs for security updates
2. Review and test changes
3. Merge within 48 hours if critical
4. Document in CHANGELOG.md

---

## Future Considerations

### Decisions to Revisit

#### 1. SVG Export (Planned)

**Current:** PNG/JPEG only  
**Future:** Add SVG export option  
**Rationale:** User demand, resolution independence, editability

#### 2. Backend (Maybe v5.0+)

**Current:** Zero-backend  
**Future:** Optional backend for cloud sync  
**Rationale:** User requests for cross-device sync, but must remain optional

#### 3. Progressive Web App

**Current:** PWA manifest added in v4.0.0  
**Future:** Full offline support with service worker  
**Rationale:** Better mobile experience, offline functionality

#### 4. WebAssembly (Maybe v5.0+)

**Current:** JavaScript FEN parsing  
**Future:** WASM for better performance  
**Rationale:** Performance boost for complex operations
