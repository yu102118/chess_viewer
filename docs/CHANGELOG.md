## [v5.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Dynamic Board Size Scaling System** - Board exports now correctly respect physical size selection (4cm, 6cm, 8cm) with accurate pixel dimensions
- **Comprehensive JSDoc Documentation** - Added detailed JSDoc comments across the entire codebase for better code maintainability
- **Professional Documentation** - Completely rewritten markdown files without emojis, using professional technical writing style
- **Standardized Import Organization** - All file imports now follow a consistent professional ordering (React/framework, third-party, internal utilities, components, styles)

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Export Dimension Bug** - Board exports now produce correctly scaled physical dimensions based on board size selection
  - 8x quality @ 4cm now produces 3,776px (small diagram for print)
  - 8x quality @ 6cm now produces 5,664px (medium diagram for print)
  - 8x quality @ 8cm now produces 7,552px (large diagram for print)
  - Quality multiplier now correctly affects both image quality and resolution without changing physical print size
- **Coordinate System Positioning** - Dynamically calculated coordinate positions now scale proportionally with board dimensions
- **Coordinate Container Borders Removed** - Clean export appearance without borders around rank/file labels
- **Export Module Issues** - Fixed incorrect property access in `getExportInfo` function (`baseSizeCm` → `physicalSizeCm`, `dpi` → `effectiveDPI`)
- **Circular Export Dependencies** - Resolved all circular export issues in component index files throughout the codebase
- **React Build Errors** - Fixed all component export patterns to eliminate Vite build failures

### Changed

- **Export Logic Refactored** - Improved calculation accuracy for dimension scaling across all quality/size combinations

### Technical Details

#### Coordinate System Improvements

- Removed visual borders from coordinate containers for cleaner exports
- Font sizes now scale dynamically: `fontSize = min(480px, max(10px, borderSize × 0.72))`
- Border sizes scale proportionally: `borderSize = min(800px, max(18px, boardPixels × 0.05))`
- Coordinates positioned using dynamic center calculations based on actual square pixel dimensions
