# Performance

Performance considerations for FENForsty Pro.

---

## Overview

Canvas-based rendering with React. No performance benchmarks have been run.

---

## Implemented Optimizations

### React.memo

Used on several components:

- ChessBoard
- BoardSquare
- MiniChessPreview
- Various control components

### useMemo / useCallback

Used in hooks for:

- Parsed board state
- Theme objects
- Export callbacks

### Code Splitting

**Not implemented.** Modals are imported synchronously.

Future improvement: Use React.lazy for modals:

- ThemeModal
- FENHistoryModal
- ExportSettingsModal
- AdvancedFENInputModal

---

## Known Performance Issues

### Large Exports

- 32x scale (12,800x12,800px) uses ~500MB memory
- Can crash low-RAM devices or Safari
- Progress not shown during processing

### Canvas Rendering

- Full redraw on any change
- No partial updates implemented
- No off-screen canvas caching

### Piece Image Loading

- Loads all pieces in selected set at startup
- No lazy loading per piece
- Cached in browser after first load

---

## Memory Usage

| Export Scale | Resolution    | Approx. Memory |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| 8x           | 3,200x3,200   | ~40MB          |
| 16x          | 6,400x6,400   | ~160MB         |
| 24x          | 9,600x9,600   | ~370MB         |
| 32x          | 12,800x12,800 | ~660MB         |

---

## Browser Limits

| Browser | Max Canvas Size               |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Chrome  | 32,767x32,767                 |
| Firefox | 32,767x32,767                 |
| Safari  | 16,384x16,384 (or 268MP area) |
| Edge    | 32,767x32,767                 |

Safari may fail on 32x exports.

---

## Not Implemented

- Performance monitoring
- Lighthouse CI in build
- Bundle size tracking
- Web Vitals reporting
- Service worker caching
- Image preloading
- Virtual scrolling for history

---

## Recommendations

1. Add Lighthouse CI to track regressions
2. Add bundle size limit checks
3. Implement off-screen canvas for caching
4. Add lazy loading for piece sets
5. Add progress reporting for exports
