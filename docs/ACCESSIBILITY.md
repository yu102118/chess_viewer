## Overview

This document honestly describes the accessibility status of FENForsty Pro based on actual implementation.

### Reality Check

- ❌ **No WCAG compliance testing done**
- ✅ Basic browser keyboard navigation works
- ❌ No custom accessibility features implemented
- ⚠️ Minimal screen reader support (just semantic HTML)
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Color customization available

---

## What Actually Exists

### 1. Browser Default Keyboard Navigation

The standard browser keyboard shortcuts work:

- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` - Navigate between elements
- `Enter` - Click buttons/links
- `Space` - Toggle checkboxes, click buttons
- `Esc` - Close modals (if implemented in modal component)

**No custom keyboard shortcuts exist.**

### 2. Semantic HTML

Basic HTML tags are used:

```jsx
<main>
  <button>...</button>
  <input type="text" />
  <select>...</select>
</main>
```

**No ARIA attributes implemented.**

### 3. Responsive Design

- Built with Tailwind CSS
- Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Touch-friendly on mobile devices

### 4. Canvas Board Rendering

- HTML5 Canvas for chess board
- High-quality rendering
- Export up to 12,800×12,800px

### 5. Color Customization

- Multiple board themes
- Custom color picker
- Users can adjust board colors

### 6. Dependencies

Based on `package.json`:

```json
{
  "react": "^19.2.3",
  "react-dom": "^19.2.3",
  "react-router-dom": "^7.11.0",
  "lucide-react": "^0.562.0",
  "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.3.5"
}
```

**No accessibility-specific libraries installed** (no axe-core, no Pa11y, no ARIA testing tools).

   - No Ctrl+E for export
   - No Ctrl+S for save
   - No F for flip board

   - ✅ Focus restoration after modal close (v3.5.2)
   - ❌ No skip-to-content link
   - ✅ Basic focus-visible styles on Button (v3.5.2)

5. **Accessibility Testing**
   - No automated testing setup
   - No axe-core integration
   - No Pa11y CI
   - No Lighthouse accessibility audits in CI/CD
   - No screen reader testing done

6. **Custom Focus Styles**

```css
/* This doesn't exist - using browser defaults */
*:focus-visible {
  /* No custom styles */
}
```

7. **Screen Reader Only Text**

```css
/* This utility class doesn't exist */
.sr-only {
  /* Not implemented */
}
```

8. **High Contrast Mode**
   - No `prefers-contrast` media query
   - No high contrast theme option

9. **Reduced Motion**
   - No `prefers-reduced-motion` support
   - Animations not disabled for users who prefer reduced motion

10. **Dark Mode**

## Known Issues

### Critical Accessibility Problems

1. **Canvas is Not Accessible**
   - Screen readers cannot read the chess board
   - No text alternative provided
   - Visually impaired users cannot understand board position

2. **No Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Users must tab through all UI elements
   - No quick access to common actions
   - Time-consuming for keyboard-only users

3. **Minimal Screen Reader Support**
   - Most interactive elements lack labels
   - No status announcements
   - Poor experience for screen reader users

4. **Export Process Silent**
   - No visual or audio feedback during export
   - Screen readers don't announce completion
   - Users don't know when export finishes

5. **Color Contrast Unknown**
   - No testing done for WCAG compliance
   - Classic chess colors likely below AA standard
   - No contrast checker implemented

6. **No Focus Indicators**
   - Using browser defaults only
   - May be hard to see on some themes
   - No custom, high-visibility focus ring

## Testing Status

### What's Been Tested

- ⚠️ Manual testing on desktop Chrome only
- ⚠️ Basic responsive testing on mobile

### What Hasn't Been Tested

- ❌ No screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- ❌ No keyboard-only navigation testing
- ❌ No color contrast testing
- ❌ No automated accessibility audits
- ❌ No testing with assistive technologies
- ❌ No WCAG compliance verification

### Testing Tools NOT Used

```bash
# These are NOT installed or configured:
# - @axe-core/react
# - pa11y
# - pa11y-ci
# - lighthouse (not in CI)
# - jest-axe
```

## Future Plans

### If We Add Accessibility (Planned)

#### Phase 1: Basic (Easy to Add)

1. Add ARIA labels to all buttons
2. Add `sr-only` utility class
3. Add basic screen reader text for canvas
4. Add simple keyboard shortcuts
5. Add custom focus styles

#### Phase 2: Medium (More Work)

1. Implement focus management in modals
2. Add status announcements (aria-live)
3. Create FEN position descriptions
4. Add high contrast theme
5. Support `prefers-reduced-motion`

#### Phase 3: Advanced (Major Effort)

1. SVG board option (better than canvas for accessibility)
2. Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. Comprehensive screen reader support
4. Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
5. Voice control support

## Honest Summary

### What Works

✅ Basic HTML structure is semantic  
✅ Standard browser keyboard navigation  
✅ Responsive layout  
✅ Works on mobile and desktop  
✅ Color customization helps some users  
✅ Basic ARIA labels on buttons and modals (v3.5.2)
✅ Focus trap in modals (v3.5.2)
✅ Error boundary for graceful failures (v3.5.2)

### What Doesn't Work

❌ Canvas board is completely inaccessible  
❌ No screen reader support for board  
❌ No keyboard shortcuts  
❌ No accessibility testing  
❌ No WCAG compliance

### Bottom Line

**This app is built for sighted users who use a mouse or touchscreen.**

Users who rely on:

- Screen readers: **Will have major difficulties**
- Keyboard-only navigation: **Will be inconvenienced**
- High contrast: **May struggle with default colors**
- Assistive technologies: **Limited or no support**

**We acknowledge these limitations and plan to improve accessibility in future versions.**
