### Privacy-First Design

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

This project follows a **zero-backend, client-side-only architecture**:

### Privacy-First Design

- **No data collection** - All processing happens in your browserThis project follows a **zero-backend, client-side-only architecture**:

- **No server storage** - No positions or images are uploaded

- **No tracking** - No analytics, cookies, or telemetry✅ **No data collection** - All processing happens in your browser

- **No third-party services** - Complete offline functionality (except piece image loading)✅ **No server storage** - No positions or images are uploaded

- **Local storage only** - Settings remain on your device✅ **No tracking** - No analytics, cookies, or telemetry

✅ **No third-party services** - Complete offline functionality

### Attack Surface✅ **Local storage only** - Settings remain on your device

- **Minimal risk:** Static client-side JavaScript only### Attack Surface

- **No authentication:** No user accounts or login system- **Minimal risk:** Static client-side JavaScript only

- **No sensitive data:** Only chess positions (FEN notation)- **No authentication:** No user accounts or login system

- **No external APIs:** All features work offline after initial load- **No sensitive data:** Only chess positions (FEN notation)

- **No external APIs:** All features work offline

### Browser Security Features

---

- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

- HTTPS-only deployment (via Vercel)## 🐞 Reporting a Vulnerability

- No inline scripts or eval() usage

- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usageIf you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

- React's built-in XSS protection

- Significant findings may be featured in the project README

- **Initial response:** Within 72 hours

- **Status update:** Within 7 days---

- **Fix timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days## 🚫 Out of Scope

  - High: 7-14 days

  - Medium: 14-30 daysThe following are **not considered security vulnerabilities**:

  - Low: Best effort

### Not Security Issues

### Disclosure Policy- ❌ UI/UX bugs or visual glitches

- ❌ Incorrect chess positions from invalid FEN input

- We follow responsible disclosure- ❌ Performance issues or slow rendering

- You will be credited (unless you prefer anonymity)- ❌ Feature requests or enhancement suggestions

- Security fixes are released without detailed exploit information- ❌ Browser compatibility issues

- Full details disclosed 90 days after fix release (or when agreed)- ❌ Issues requiring user to modify source code

- ❌ Social engineering attacks

---- ❌ Physical access to user's device

## Potential Security Concerns### Known Limitations (By Design)

- FEN notation validation is permissive by design

### Input Validation- Browser localStorage is used (can be cleared by user)

- No encryption for local data (not needed for public chess positions)

**FEN String Parsing**

- User input is validated before parsing---

- Invalid FEN rejected with error message

- No code execution from FEN input## 📦 Dependency Security

- Maximum input length enforced

### Third-Party Libraries

**Color Inputs**This project uses the following major dependencies:

- Hex color validation- **React** (v18+, built with v19.x)

- Safe color parsing- **Vite** (build tool)

- No CSS injection possible- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)

- **Lucide React** (icons)

### Canvas Operations

### Dependency Updates

- 🔄 **Automated:** Dependabot monitors for security updates
- 🔍 **Manual review:** Monthly security audits via `pnpm audit`
- ⚡ **Quick response:** Critical vulnerabilities patched within 48 hours
- 📋 **Changelog:** All dependency updates documented

### How to Check Dependencies

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities in your local installation
pnpm audit

# View detailed security report
pnpm audit --json

# Fix automatically (when possible)
pnpm audit fix
```

## Known Non-Issues

---

These are **not** security vulnerabilities:

## 🔒 Best Practices for Users

- **No HTTPS on localhost** - Development only

- **console.log statements** - Removed in production build### For End Users

- **Source maps** - Disabled in production- ✅ Always use the latest version from the official repo

- **Dependency vulnerabilities (dev-only)** - Not shipped to users- ✅ Clear browser cache after updates

- **Large memory usage on exports** - Expected browser behavior- ✅ Report suspicious behavior immediately

- ✅ Don't modify source code from untrusted sources

---

### For Developers/Contributors

## Security Best Practices for Users- ✅ Review code changes carefully before committing

- ✅ Run `pnpm audit` before submitting PRs

### Recommended Actions- ✅ Follow secure coding practices

- ✅ Never commit sensitive data or API keys

- Use the **latest browser version**- ✅ Use environment variables for configuration

- Enable **browser security features**- ✅ Sanitize user inputs (even though we only accept FEN notation)

- Don't install **browser extensions** from untrusted sources

- Clear **localStorage** if using a shared computer---

### What We Don't Need## 📄 Security Disclosure Policy

- No password requirements (no accounts)### Responsible Disclosure

- No 2FA (no authentication)We follow a **coordinated disclosure** approach:

- No session management (stateless)

- No CORS configuration (no API)1. **Private notification** → Security issue is reported privately

2. **Acknowledgment** → We confirm receipt within 48 hours

---3. **Investigation** → We assess and validate the issue

4. **Fix development** → We develop and test a patch

## Third-Party Dependencies5. **Coordinated release** → We release the fix in a new version

6. **Public disclosure** → We publish details after users have time to update (typically 7-14 days)

### Dependency Security

### Public Disclosure

- Dependencies audited regularly with `pnpm audit`
- Security patches applied promptly
- Minimal dependency footprint
- No dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities

### Public Disclosure

After a fix is released, we will:

- 📊 Share lessons learned with the community
