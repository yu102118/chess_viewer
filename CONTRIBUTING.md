## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 9
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chess_viewer.git
cd chess_viewer
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build    # production build → dist/
pnpm preview  # serve dist/ locally
```

---

## Making Changes

### Branching

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### Coding Standards

- All exported functions use `export function` declarations (no arrow function exports).
- All exported functions and components have JSDoc with `@param` and `@returns`.
- Memo components: `const X = memo(function X({ props }) { ... })`.
- Import order: React/framework → third-party → `@/` paths → relative paths.
- No unnecessary inline comments; keep logic readable without them.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.

### Commit Messages

Prefix commits with a type:

| Prefix     | Use case                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Add:`     | New feature or file                              |
| `Fix:`     | Bug fix                                          |
| `Update:`  | Modification to existing functionality           |
| `Refactor:`| Code cleanup without behavior change             |
| `Docs:`    | Documentation only                               |

Example:

```
Add: board flip functionality
Fix: piece drag-and-drop on mobile
Refactor: split canvasExporter into smaller functions
```
