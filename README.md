## Overview

FENForsty Pro parses FEN notation and renders chess positions as high-resolution raster or vector images. It is designed for chess players, coaches, authors, and developers who need precise, customizable board diagrams without a backend dependency.

All processing happens in the browser. No data leaves the user's device.

---

## Features

### Core

- Full FEN notation support with real-time validation
- Multi-position input — up to 10 positions simultaneously
- PNG and JPEG export with resolutions up to 24,192 × 24,192 px
- SVG export
- Batch export across multiple positions and formats
- Clipboard copy

### Board and Themes

- 23 professional piece sets (Classic to Modern)
- Complete color picker with HSL, RGB, and HEX modes
- 20+ preset themes plus custom theme creation and preset management
- Board flip and coordinate toggle
- Adjustable physical board dimensions (cm-based)

### Position Management

- FEN history with favorites, pinning, and search
- Auto-archival of older entries
- Archive browser with filter and restore

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 9

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BilgeGates/chess_viewer.git
cd chess_viewer
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev server starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build    # outputs to dist/
pnpm preview  # serves the dist/ locally
```

```

Each directory exports symbols through an `index.js` barrel file.

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **Feature-based component grouping**: each major feature has its own subdirectory under `components/features/`
- **No prop drilling for theme**: theme state is managed through `ThemeSettingsContext`
- **Canvas pipeline**: high-res export uses a multi-stage canvas pipeline (`canvasRenderer.js` → `canvasExporter.js` → `advancedExport.js`)
- **Lazy-loaded routes**: all page components are loaded with `React.lazy` / `Suspense`

## Export System

Board export dimensions are computed from a physical board size (cm) and a quality multiplier:

```
pixelDimension = boardSizeCm × qualityMultiplier × 118.11
```

### Print Mode (8x, 16x)

Output dimensions scale with the selected board size. Suitable for print-quality diagrams.

| Quality | Board size | Dimensions          | Est. file size | DPI   |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 8x      | 4 cm       | 3,776 × 3,776 px    | 70–150 KB      | 2,400 |
| 8x      | 6 cm       | 5,664 × 5,664 px    | 140–300 KB     | 2,400 |
| 8x      | 8 cm       | 7,552 × 7,552 px    | 250–500 KB     | 2,400 |
| 16x     | 6 cm       | 11,328 × 11,328 px  | 500–900 KB     | 4,800 |

### Social Mode (24x, 32x)

Fixed large output regardless of board size. Suitable for social media and screen zoom.

| Quality | Dimensions          | Est. file size | Use case            |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| 24x     | 18,112 × 18,112 px  | 1.2–2.0 MB     | Social media        |
| 32x     | 24,192 × 24,192 px  | 2.5–4.0 MB     | Professional print  |

---

## Browser Support

| Browser | Minimum version |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Chrome  | 90+             |
| Firefox | 88+             |
| Safari  | 14+             |
| Edge    | 90+             |

Required browser APIs: Canvas API, Clipboard API (optional), localStorage, ES2020+.

## Security and Privacy

FENForsty Pro has no backend. All computation runs client-side.

- No server-side data storage
- No cookies, trackers, or telemetry
- No external API calls during runtime
- No user accounts or authentication
- Positions, exports, favorites, and settings remain local to the user's device
